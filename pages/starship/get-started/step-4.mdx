# **Step 4:** Interact with the chains

In this step, we will connect with the runnings nodes, check the logs and interact with the chains.

## 4.1) Prerequisites
Step-3 infrastructure should be up and running. Check the pods are in running state with

```bash
kubectl get pods

# You should see something like
NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
explorer-5dd48ffc8d-jrtsh   1/1     Running   0          37m
gaia-1-genesis-0            2/2     Running   0          37m
hermes-osmos-gaia-0         1/1     Running   0          37m
osmosis-1-genesis-0         2/2     Running   0          37m
registry-7f9f9f9f9f-2q2q2   1/1     Running   0          37m
```

## 4.2) Interact with the chains
You can then interact with the chain on localhost at
* Osmosis: http://localhost:26653/status
* Cosmos: http://localhost:26657/status

And open up the explorer at http://localhost:8080
> Note explorer can take some extra time to get ready, we are trying to make explorer initialization faster. You can check the logs of the explorer pod to see if it is ready.
```bash
kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=explorer
```

### Registry service endpoints
Registry service is a central service that keeps track of all the chains, keys, endpoints and ibc channels. It is based
on the cosmos/chain-registry, with some customizations.

You can check the following endpoints on the registry service to get an idea of the infra:

* Chains:
    * http://localhost:8081/chains: will list all the chains
    * http://localhost:8081/chains/osmosis-1
    * http://localhost:8081/chains/gaia-1
* Chain Assets:
    * http://localhost:8081/chains/osmosis-1/assets
    * http://localhost:8081/chains/gaia-1/assets
* IBC Channels:
    * http://localhost:8081/ibc/osmosis-1/gaia-1: ibc channels between osmosis and cosmos chain
* Keys:
    * http://localhost:8081/chains/osmosis-1/keys: all the mnemonics for osmosis chain
    * http://localhost:8081/chains/gaia-1/keys: all the mnemonics for osmosis chain

## 4.3) Check chain logs
You can check the logs of the chain with
```bash
# Osmosis logs
kubectl logs osmosis-1-genesis-0
# OR, follow the logs with
kubectl logs -f osmosis-1-genesis-0

# Cosmos logs
kubectl logs gaia-1-genesis-0
# OR, follow the logs with
kubectl logs -f gaia-1-genesis-0
```

## 4.4) Cleanup
Once you are done with playing around, cleanup the resources with

```bash
# delete helm chart
starship stop --config config.yaml

# cleanup port forwarding
pkill -f "port-forward"
```
