# **Step 1:** Setup dependencies

_You can skip directly to **TLDR** for the quickest start._

In this step, we will setup the dependencies for our project. We will use
* `docker`
* `kubectl`
* `helm`

> Note: For local setup make sure you have docker setup and running. Run `docker ps` to check if docker is running.

## 1.1) Installation
Run the following commands to get the dependencies installed.
```bash
npm install -g @starship-ci/cli
```

Run following command to install all the dependencies
```bash
starship install
```

## 1.2) Manual Installation
If you want to install the dependencies manually, please follow the instructions of each of
the required dependencies

* `docker`: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
* `kubectl`: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/
* `helm`: https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/
