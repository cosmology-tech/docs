# **Step 2:** Kubernetes Cluster

In this step, we will setup a Kubernetes cluster using `Docker Desktop` or `kind`.
Optionally if you have a Kubernetes cluster already, you can skip this step.

By the end of this tutorial you should be able to run `kubectl get nodes` and see a list of nodes.

Please **follow any one of the following** sections to setup a Kubernetes cluster.

## 2.1) Setup with Docker Desktop
Docker Desktop includes a standalone Kubernetes server and client, as well as Docker CLI integration that runs on your machine.

### Enable kubernetes
To enable Kubernetes in Docker Desktop:

* From the Docker Dashboard, select the Settings.
* Select **Kubernetes** from the left sidebar.
* Next to **Enable Kubernetes**, select the checkbox.
* Select **Apply & Restart** to save the settings and then click Install to confirm.

> Note: You might want to increase the memory and cpu allocated to the cluster, in Settings, Resources

### Connect with kubectl
```bash
# list of all the contexts
kubectl config get-contexts

# set the context to docker-desktop
kubectl config use-context docker-desktop
```

## 2.2) Check Access to kubernetes

Once you are connected to a kubernetes cluster, you should be able to run the following command and see a list of nodes.
```bash
kubectl get nodes
```
